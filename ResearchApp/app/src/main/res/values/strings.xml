    <string name="instructions">When you continue on to the next screen, the front camera\'s view
                                will appear. Once your face is in view, the face recognition will
                                highlight your face and instruct you to move closer or further away
                                from the camera. Upon moving into the correct position, a picture
                                will be taken. This process will take

                                recognize your face, there are two lines on screen that you can use
                                to position your face such that your hairline is at the top line and
                                the bottom of your chin is at the bottom line. You will then use the
                                camera button on the bottom right to take a picture manually.</string>
